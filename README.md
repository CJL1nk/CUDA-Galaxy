This project mostly exists cuz I wanted to learn CUDA

I used both CUDA and OpenGL for this which is a bit counterintuitive as I could go it in just OpenGL for better performance, but that'd defeat the point

All the OpenGL code is stock generic window code I found, so idk if it's any good but it works

Really good material for learning CUDA here: https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/cuda-training-series/
